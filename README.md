# Utilipy - A small collection of simple Python scripts
## About
This is a small collection of simple Python scripts that I will continue to refine, adjust, and expand.
Everything is still in a basic testing phase.

### Collection (so far)
* passwdgen.py - "Password" generator using Python's secrets
* hashstring.py - A quick string hashing tool
* keepy.py - Basic keylogger

### Feel Free to Help 
As always, if there are any obvious mistakes or better ways of doing things, feel free to let me know through issues or
pull request.
